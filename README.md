# Project Ideas

+ Mush: A scripting language
  + Shell scripting languages are mostly horrible.
  + Invoking processes in languages like Python and Ruby is too syntactically cumbersome to make
    them good replacements for shell scripting.
  + This new language would make invoking processes the way one does in a shell script
    syntactically simple, but still include proper control flow.
  + It would have sum types, and treat errors as values the way that Rust does.

+ Personal website
  + Information about me
  + Portfolio
  + Maybe a blog
  + Maybe serverless

+ AI Snake 2: Remake it with Bevy

+ Accompli: A task managing app similar to Trello or GitHub Projects

+ 2D strategy game with mechanics similar to Into the Breach and Armies of Gielinor

+ A Wayland compositor similar to Hyprland, but written in Rust.
